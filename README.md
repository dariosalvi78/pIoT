========================================================================================

pIoT is an open source pico/personal framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). It includes a hardware design for low-cost, low-power, Arduino compatible boards, a C++ library for programming the board and a simple server application that stores data and offers web visualization.

This repo is a container of the three sub repos for hardware design (pIoT-HW), the code that runs in the microcontrollers (pIoT-FW) and the server application (pIoT-SW). This repo also includes a wiki with further documentation about the project and a tutorial
