========================================================================================

pIoT is an open source pico/personal framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). It includes a hardware design for low-cost, low-power, Arduino compatible boards, a C++ library for programming the board and a simple server application that stores data and offers web visualization.

This repo is a container of the three sub repos for hardware design (pIoT-HW), the code that runs in the microcontrollers (pIoT-FW) and the server application (pIoT-SW and pIoT-JS). This repo also includes a wiki with further documentation about the project and a tutorial.

## Submodules

* [pIoT-HW](https://github.com/dariosalvi78/pIoT-HW), instructions of how to build the nodes
* [pIoT-FW](https://github.com/dariosalvi78/pIoT-FW), the Arduino code that runs on the nodes
* [pIoT-SW](https://github.com/dariosalvi78/pIoT-SW), a Java server with a web interface
* [pIoT-JS](https://github.com/dariosalvi78/pIoT-JS), a Javascript server that runs on nodejs
